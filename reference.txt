#1. Allow User to login and edit their account - Done

#2. When new user logs in for the first time, taken to edit account (skip admin pg) - DONE !!!!!
When they log out and back in they are sent to admin page.
    - add if statement to login to check if user has logged in before
    - query database and check IP; if no ip (NULL), user had not logged in * need to pull user_ip from DB 
    - redirect_to edit user page. *

#3. Users with admin access can edit other user accounts, 
normal users can only edit their own account.
    - need to list all user accounts available - done
    - make new file page admin_editallusers.php - done
    - make link to all users only available to admin - done
    *utilize isCurrentUserAdminAbove() like create user page

    - how to get user information to populate fields?
    - how to ensure other user is getting updated, not own account?

    - maybe.. instead of linking to admin_edituser.php,
    - show all users with forms on editallusers page
    * each for will submit its own info to update db

#4. New users have a time limit to log into their account after creation. 
Account is suspended if time expires.
    - add account_created column to table
    - when user created, update account_created column to current_timestamp
    - when logging in, check account_created column
    - if longer than 24hrs, log in is not permitted.

    ** Run Query to Select account_created column and use DATE_ADD, account_created, INTERVAL 10 MIN and **
    ** check if greater than NOW(current time) **
        $query = SELECT * FROM tbl_user WHERE user_name = "admin" AND user_pass= "123" AND DATE_ADD(account_created, INTERVAL 10 MINUTE) > NOW();

    // How to Update so that user can login without checking time?
    // Utilize #2 feature when user logs in > check if first login > also check account_created *above query > login
